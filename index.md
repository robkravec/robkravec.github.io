Shiny app that generates animations of NFL passing plays from the 2018 season,
using a custom-built theme. 
Inspired by [NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021){:target="_blank"}.

Those interested in producing their own American football plots can check-out my
`ggfootball` [package](https://github.com/robkravec/ggfootball){:target="_blank"} in R. To install, simply
use the following command: `devtools::install_github("robkravec/ggfootball")`

#### [Python Implementation of t-SNE](https://github.com/robkravec/t-SNE-Implementation/blob/main/README.md){:target="_blank"}

<img src="images/Steps3.png?raw=true"/>

Python implementation of t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) based on van der Maaten and Hinton's 2008 paper, ["Visualizing Data using t-SNE"](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The linked 
repository contains a reproducible report that discusses the t-SNE algorithm in depth (including optimization opportunities) and demonstrates results on both simulated and real datasets. This homebrewed t-SNE implementation can also be downloaded using the `setup.py` file provided in the repository.

#### [Hierachical Modeling Demo](https://github.com/robkravec/Hierarchical-Modeling-Demo){:target="_blank"}

<img src="images/hierarchical_anim_plt.gif?raw=true"/>

Educational tool to demonstrate principles of hierarchical modeling based on an analysis of Major
League Baseball (MLB) data. When the results do not turn out exactly as planned, I discuss potential causes, 
perform model diagnostics, and investigate the impact of sample size

#### [Atlanta Braves Statcast Data Exploration](https://github.com/robkravec/Atlanta-Braves-Pitching){:target="_blank"}

<img src="images/fried_arsenal.png?raw=true"/>

Exploration of 2017-2020 Atlanta Braves Statcast data (pitchers only). Sub-projects include:

- Pitch classification using gradient boosted tree model (XGBoost)
- Interactive plots of pitch movement using ggiraph package
- Evolution of Atlanta Braves pitching staff over time, stitched together with patchwork package
- Comparison of actual ball / strike calls to an "objective strike zone"
