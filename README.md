# Personal Website

This repository generates a simple personal website to:

- Showcase my data science portfolio
- Provide a one-stop-shop for relevant links (e.g., resume, LinkedIn)

Next updates (after spring semester):

- Add additional projects
- Add sections for relevant courses and teaching experience
